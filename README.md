# BenefitsService

**BenefitsService** is a REST API built with **.NET 9** that allows clients to:

- View a list of employees
- View an employee’s dependents
- View an employee’s salary (gross & net)
- View an employee’s benefit deductions
- Add new dependents to an employee’s record

The service is built using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles and uses **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** with a **SQLite** database. Swagger UI is included for easy API testing and exploration.

## 🧱 Project Structure

The solution is organized into the following projects:

```
\---src
    +---BenefitsService.API # Entry point for the web API. Hosts all REST endpoints and handles HTTP concerns.
    |   +---Controllers # Controllers to handle routing of HTTP requests & returning responses.
    |   \---Properties # Configure launch settings for running application.
    +---BenefitsService.Application # Responsible for coordinating domain operations & invoking services/repositories.
    |   +---DTO # POCO objects for transferring data between the various projects.
    |   +---Extensions # Extension helper methods, source of mapping methods.
    |   +---Interfaces # Interfaces for application services.
    |   \---Services # Services that orchestrate request fulfillment.
    +---BenefitsService.Domain # Core domain logic/business rules (e.g., employee entities, benefit deduction rules, salary calculations).
    |   +---Aggregates # Key entry point for entity with business logic & dependent entities.
    |   +---Entities # Core domain entities that don't warrant an aggregate, also includes dependent entities.
    |   +---Enums # Enums for less dynamic data.
    |   +---Interfaces # Core domain interfaces that can be implemented by external consumers.
    \---BenefitsService.Infrastructure # Third party infrastructure such as ORM & repository implementations.
        +---Migrations # Code-first migrations for ORM implementation.
        \---Repositories # Data access implementations using domain entities.
```
